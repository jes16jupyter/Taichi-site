# Move Language Security: Best Practices for Aptos and Sui

The Move programming language, designed by Facebook (now Meta) for blockchain applications, introduces novel security concepts that differentiate it from other smart contract languages. This post explores Move's unique security features and best practices for secure development.

## Resource Safety

Move's resource-oriented programming model ensures that digital assets cannot be copied or lost, only moved between accounts.

### Resource Definition

```move
module MyModule::Coin {
    /// A coin resource that represents value
    struct Coin has key, store {
        value: u64
    }
    
    /// Create a new coin (only callable by module)
    public fun mint(value: u64): Coin {
        Coin { value }
    }
    
    /// Destroy a coin and return its value
    public fun burn(coin: Coin): u64 {
        let Coin { value } = coin;
        value
    }
    
    /// Transfer value from one coin to another
    public fun join(coin1: &mut Coin, coin2: Coin) {
        let Coin { value } = coin2;
        coin1.value = coin1.value + value;
    }
}
```

### Key Security Properties

The Move type system enforces several critical security properties:

1. **Linear Types**: Resources cannot be copied or dropped
2. **Resource Safety**: Values cannot be lost or duplicated
3. **Capability-Based Security**: Access control through unforgeable tokens

### Mathematical Guarantees

Move's type system provides mathematical guarantees about resource conservation:

$$\forall \text{ transactions } T: \sum_{i} \text{Resources}_{before}(T) = \sum_{i} \text{Resources}_{after}(T)$$

This ensures that the total supply of any resource remains constant unless explicitly minted or burned.

## Capability-Based Security

Move implements capability-based security, where access is controlled through unforgeable tokens rather than access control lists.

### Admin Capability Pattern

```move
module MyModule::Admin {
    use std::signer;
    
    /// Admin capability resource
    struct AdminCap has key, store {}
    
    /// Witness pattern for one-time initialization
    struct AdminCapWitness has drop {}
    
    /// Initialize admin capability (only once)
    public fun init_admin(admin: &signer) {
        move_to(admin, AdminCap {});
    }
    
    /// Check if signer has admin capability
    public fun has_admin_cap(admin: address): bool {
        exists<AdminCap>(admin)
    }
    
    /// Require admin capability for sensitive operations
    public fun require_admin(admin: &signer) acquires AdminCap {
        assert!(exists<AdminCap>(signer::address_of(admin)), 1);
        borrow_global<AdminCap>(signer::address_of(admin));
    }
}
```

### Capability Delegation

```move
module MyModule::Treasury {
    use MyModule::Admin::{Self, AdminCap};
    
    /// Withdrawal capability that can be delegated
    struct WithdrawCap has key, store {
        limit: u64,
        used: u64,
    }
    
    /// Create a withdrawal capability (admin only)
    public fun create_withdraw_cap(
        admin: &signer, 
        limit: u64
    ): WithdrawCap acquires AdminCap {
        Admin::require_admin(admin);
        WithdrawCap { limit, used: 0 }
    }
    
    /// Use withdrawal capability
    public fun withdraw_with_cap(
        cap: &mut WithdrawCap, 
        amount: u64
    ): bool {
        if (cap.used + amount <= cap.limit) {
            cap.used = cap.used + amount;
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    }
}
```

## Module System Security

Move's module system provides strong encapsulation and prevents unauthorized access to internal functions.

### Public vs Friend Functions

```move
module MyModule::Bank {
    use std::signer;
    
    /// Private struct - only accessible within module
    struct Account has key {
        balance: u64,
        frozen: bool,
    }
    
    /// Public function - anyone can call
    public fun get_balance(addr: address): u64 acquires Account {
        if (exists<Account>(addr)) {
            borrow_global<Account>(addr).balance
        } else {
            0
        }
    }
    
    /// Public(friend) function - only trusted modules can call
    public(friend) fun internal_transfer(
        from: address, 
        to: address, 
        amount: u64
    ) acquires Account {
        // Implementation details...
    }
    
    /// Private function - only this module can call
    fun validate_account(account: &Account): bool {
        !account.frozen && account.balance > 0
    }
}

/// Friend module that can call public(friend) functions
module MyModule::Exchange {
    use MyModule::Bank;
    
    public fun swap_tokens(user: &signer, amount: u64) {
        // Can call Bank::internal_transfer because we're a friend
        Bank::internal_transfer(
            signer::address_of(user), 
            @exchange_pool, 
            amount
        );
    }
}
```

## Advanced Security Patterns

### Witness Pattern for Initialization

```move
module MyModule::SingletonResource {
    /// A resource that should only exist once
    struct GlobalConfig has key {
        max_supply: u64,
        initialized: bool,
    }
    
    /// Witness struct that can only be created once
    struct InitWitness has drop {}
    
    /// Initialize the global config (can only be called once)
    public fun initialize(
        admin: &signer, 
        _witness: InitWitness, 
        max_supply: u64
    ) {
        move_to(admin, GlobalConfig {
            max_supply,
            initialized: true,
        });
    }
    
    /// This function can only be called in the module's init function
    fun create_witness(): InitWitness {
        InitWitness {}
    }
    
    /// Module initialization - automatically called once
    fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
        initialize(admin, create_witness(), 1000000);
    }
}
```

### Hot Potato Pattern for Forced Consumption

```move
module MyModule::FlashLoan {
    /// Hot potato struct - has no abilities, must be consumed
    struct FlashLoan {
        amount: u64,
        fee: u64,
    }
    
    /// Borrow funds (creates hot potato)
    public fun borrow(amount: u64): FlashLoan {
        // Transfer funds to caller...
        FlashLoan { 
            amount, 
            fee: amount / 100 // 1% fee
        }
    }
    
    /// Repay loan (consumes hot potato)
    public fun repay(loan: FlashLoan) {
        let FlashLoan { amount, fee } = loan;
        // Verify repayment of amount + fee...
        // Hot potato is consumed, ensuring repayment
    }
    
    /// Cannot store or drop FlashLoan - must be repaid!
}
```

## Testing and Verification

### Unit Testing with Move

```move
#[test_only]
module MyModule::CoinTests {
    use MyModule::Coin;
    
    #[test]
    fun test_coin_creation() {
        let coin = Coin::mint(100);
        assert!(Coin::value(&coin) == 100, 1);
        Coin::burn(coin);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fun test_coin_join() {
        let coin1 = Coin::mint(100);
        let coin2 = Coin::mint(50);
        
        Coin::join(&mut coin1, coin2);
        assert!(Coin::value(&coin1) == 150, 1);
        
        Coin::burn(coin1);
    }
    
    #[test]
    #[expected_failure]
    fun test_cannot_copy_coin() {
        let coin = Coin::mint(100);
        let _copied_coin = copy coin; // This should fail
        Coin::burn(coin);
    }
}
```

### Property-Based Testing

```move
#[test_only]
module MyModule::PropertyTests {
    use MyModule::Coin;
    
    /// Property: total value is conserved during operations
    #[test]
    fun property_value_conservation(
        value1: u64, 
        value2: u64
    ) {
        let coin1 = Coin::mint(value1);
        let coin2 = Coin::mint(value2);
        
        let initial_total = value1 + value2;
        
        Coin::join(&mut coin1, coin2);
        let final_value = Coin::burn(coin1);
        
        assert!(final_value == initial_total, 1);
    }
}
```

## Formal Verification

Move supports formal verification through the Move Prover, which can mathematically prove correctness properties.

### Specification Example

```move
module MyModule::VerifiedBank {
    spec module {
        /// Global invariant: total supply never changes unexpectedly
        global invariant<T>: 
            old(global<TotalSupply<T>>(TREASURY).value) == 
            global<TotalSupply<T>>(TREASURY).value;
    }
    
    /// Bank account resource
    struct Account has key {
        balance: u64
    }
    
    /// Transfer function with specifications
    public fun transfer(
        from: &signer, 
        to: address, 
        amount: u64
    ) acquires Account {
        spec {
            let from_addr = signer::address_of(from);
            requires exists<Account>(from_addr);
            requires exists<Account>(to);
            requires global<Account>(from_addr).balance >= amount;
            
            ensures global<Account>(from_addr).balance == 
                    old(global<Account>(from_addr).balance) - amount;
            ensures global<Account>(to).balance == 
                    old(global<Account>(to).balance) + amount;
        };
        
        // Implementation...
        let from_account = borrow_global_mut<Account>(signer::address_of(from));
        let to_account = borrow_global_mut<Account>(to);
        
        assert!(from_account.balance >= amount, 1);
        from_account.balance = from_account.balance - amount;
        to_account.balance = to_account.balance + amount;
    }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Leverage the Type System

```move
// Use distinct types for different concepts
struct USD has store { value: u64 }
struct EUR has store { value: u64 }

// Compiler prevents mixing currencies
public fun exchange_usd_to_eur(usd: USD): EUR {
    // Implementation with proper exchange rate
    EUR { value: usd.value * 85 / 100 } // Simplified
}
```

### 2. Use Capabilities for Access Control

```move
// Better than address-based checks
public fun admin_function(admin_cap: &AdminCap) {
    // Function implementation
}

// Instead of:
// public fun admin_function(admin: &signer) {
//     assert!(signer::address_of(admin) == @admin_address, 1);
// }
```

### 3. Implement Proper Error Handling

```move
// Use descriptive error codes
const INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE: u64 = 1;
const ACCOUNT_FROZEN: u64 = 2;
const UNAUTHORIZED: u64 = 3;

public fun withdraw(account: &signer, amount: u64) {
    assert!(get_balance(account) >= amount, INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE);
    assert!(!is_frozen(account), ACCOUNT_FROZEN);
    // Implementation...
}
```

## Conclusion

Move's unique approach to smart contract security provides strong guarantees about resource safety and access control. By leveraging the type system, capability-based security, and formal verification tools, developers can build more secure decentralized applications.

The key advantages of Move's security model include:

- **Resource Safety**: Mathematical guarantees about asset conservation
